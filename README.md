### Hi, I'm Aldien ðŸ‘‹

I'm a writer, geoscientist and machine learning enthusiast.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at an multinational oil and gas services.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to solve real-world problems through an application. 
- ðŸ‘¯ I have no background in computer science or entrepreurship. Although I've spent my time to learn web development and data science through either bootcamp or online courses. 
- âš¡ Yes, I loved to taking risk too. I have a couple of failure of building business, to name a few: laundry services, babyshop retail and international dropshipping. Despite of failure, I am enjoying small and medium rewards through a couple of investment and business too.   
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm best reached via email. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.

*Fun fact* : I have been traveling and working to many countries in order to find new potential oil and gas reservoir.
